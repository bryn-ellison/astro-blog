# Astro tutorial blog

This project is a simple blog created using the Astro tutorial.

It includes the use of components, layouts and markdown files to generate posts and pages dynamically.

It inlcudes a simple Preact island and various JS script tags for user interactivity.

Astro seems like a very pleasant bit of kit to work with!
